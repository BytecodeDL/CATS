/**
 * Class modeling a square expression.
 * 
 * This class declares two inner private classes but uses only one of them. The dead inner 
 * class seems like it escapes the local scope via deserialization like in the test case 
 * featured in IdentityExpression$IdentityOperator but always returns an instance of the 
 * other inner class during deserialization.
 *
 * <!--

 * purposes.
 *

 *
 *
 *
 *
 * INTENTIONALLY LEFT EMPTY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SPECIFIED LINE NUMBERS ARE STABLE IF THE
 * CODE (E.G. IMPORTS) CHANGE.
