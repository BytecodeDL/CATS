# Java Call Graph (JCG)

This repository accommodates the Java Call Graph (JCG) project, a collection of annotated test cases
that are relevant for call-graph construction in Java. The test cases specifically target the call
graph's soundness and, therefore, tests the correct support of Java language features, core APIs, and
runtime (JVM) callbacks. Not supporting those features/APIs will render the call graph unsound.
