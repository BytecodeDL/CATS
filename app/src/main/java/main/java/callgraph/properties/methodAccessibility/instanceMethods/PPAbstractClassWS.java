 * Since this class is abstract it is not possible to create an instance of it.
 * But via inheritance through a subclass is it possible to get access to the methods
 * when there are not overridden. This class is package private, that implies that a client
 * that is not able to contribute to this given package can not access the already implemented
 * methods, no matter what visibility modifier they have. This class has no public subclass,
 * hence, all methods should be maximal package local under the closed packages assumption.
 *
