/**
 * This class was used to create a class file with some well defined attributes.
 * The created class is subsequently used by several tests.
 * 
 * Serializable class with private no-args constructor. Used as a superclass for another serializable 
 * class. Implements readResolve and writeReplace, which are only called if this class is 
 * (de-)serialized directly. Also contains the readObjectNoData method, which is called if a
 * subclass which was serialized before the inheritance was added is de-serialized.
 * 
 * <b>NOTE</b><br>
 * This class is not meant to be (automatically) recompiled; it just serves
 * documentation purposes.
