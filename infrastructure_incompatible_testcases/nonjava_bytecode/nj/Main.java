/**
 *  In Java it is not possible to have a subclass that defines a method with the same name and
 *  signature, but which is static. This is, however, possible at the bytecode level and the JVM
 *  will call the default method.
 *
 *  This test case pertains to an evolution scenario and cannot be compiled out of the box. Please
 *  proceed with the following steps to obtain all class files required by the test case:
 *
 *  Step one:
 *  Compile the Main.java as is with the method with the markers *METHOD 1* (LINE 33) and *METHOD 3*
 *  (LINE 58) uncommented and the method with the marker *METHOD 2* (LINE 37) commented. Then take the
 *  resulting class files of "C", "Helper", "SuperIntf", "SubIntf", and "Main" and put tom into a
 *  folder named "nj".
 *
 *  Step two:
 *  Now comment the lines with the markers *METHOD 1* and *METHOD 3* and uncomment the line with the
 *  marker *METHOD 2*. Then compile "Main.java" again and copy "Intf" class' class file to the folder
 *  named "nj".
 *
 *  Step three:
 *  Next to the folder "nj" add a folder named "META-INF" with the respective "MANIFEST.MF" file which
 *  declares "nj/Main" as main class.
 *
 *  Step four:
 *  Compress both folders and create an executeable ".jar" file.
