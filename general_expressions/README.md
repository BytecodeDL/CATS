This JCG sub-project contains all cases not waranting their own sub-project. The project implements a library modeling simple arithmetic expressions and an app using said library to process arithmetic expressions. Folowing features of java programing language are used:
* Private classes instantiable with factory methods
* Finalization with the finalize() method
* Runnable interface with the run() method
* Running code with Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler
* Running code with AddShutdownHook
* Classes implementing Serializable and Externalizable interfaces without the app performing (de-)serialization
