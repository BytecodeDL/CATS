 * This class was used to create a class file with some well defined attributes. The
 * created class is subsequently used by several tests.
 * 
 * Class contains a nested private class never instantiated. Similarly to example in callgraph/nestedClassSerializable 
 * the class can still be de-serialized. However here the de-serialization always leads to an exception 
 * thrown by readExternal before readResolve is ever called.
