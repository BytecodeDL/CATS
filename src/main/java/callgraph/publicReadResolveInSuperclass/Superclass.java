/**
 * This class was used to create a class file with some well defined attributes.
 * The created class is subsequently used by several tests.
 * 
 * This class contains a nested serializable class extending another serializable class. No new 
 * instances of the nested class can be created but old versions can be de-serialized. However the 
 * superclass implements a public readResolve method which replaces all de-serialized instances of 
 * this class at the end of de-serialization process. This class also has two private methods:
 * One is alive because it is called during de-serialization, other is dead because it is not.
 * 
 * <b>NOTE</b><br>
 * This class is not meant to be (automatically) recompiled; it just serves
 * documentation purposes.
