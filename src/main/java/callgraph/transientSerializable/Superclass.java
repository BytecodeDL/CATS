/**
 * This class was used to create a class file with some well defined attributes. The
 * created class is subsequently used by several tests.
 * 
 * The nested class has a private method which is only called during de-serialization. However the 
 * call is gated by an check if the chooser field is 0. This is always the case immediately after 
 * de-serialization as the field is transient and thus is de-serialized to 0.
 * 
 * <b>NOTE</b><br>
 * This class is not meant to be (automatically) recompiled; it just serves documentation
 * purposes.
