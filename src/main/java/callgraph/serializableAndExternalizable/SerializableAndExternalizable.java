/**
 * This class was used to create a class file with some well defined attributes. The
 * created class is subsequently used by several tests.
 * 
 * This class implements both Externalizable and Serializable interfaces. Apart from being redundant 
 * (as Externalizable is a sub-interface of Serializable) this doesn't generate any strange behavior. 
 * The readExternal defines the manner of reading the class data from the stream and afterwards the 
 * readResolve method is called to reconstruct the class from the data read.
 * 
 * <b>NOTE</b><br>
 * This class is not meant to be (automatically) recompiled; it just serves documentation
 * purposes.
