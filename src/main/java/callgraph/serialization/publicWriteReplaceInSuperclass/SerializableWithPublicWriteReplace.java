/**
 * This class was used to create a class file with some well defined attributes.
 * The created class is subsequently used by several tests.
 * 
 * Serializable class with public writeReplace method. It returns a new instance of this class with 
 * label marked as being replaced. This method is called whenever this class or one of its subclasses 
 * attempts a serialization. If a subclass causes the method to be called, it is called twice.
 * 
 * <b>NOTE</b><br>
 * This class is not meant to be (automatically) recompiled; it just serves
