/**
 * This class was used to create a class file with some well defined attributes.
 * The created class is subsequently used by several tests.
 * 
 * This class implements externalizable and extends a class with private no-args constructor. 
 * Unlike with plain Serializable this is not a problem. The field of the superclass is not 
 * explicitly read or written by read/writeExternal and thus set to the default value after
 * de-serialization.
 * 
 * <b>NOTE</b><br>
 * This class is not meant to be (automatically) recompiled; it just serves
 * documentation purposes.
