/**
 * This class was used to create a class file with some well defined attributes. The
 * created class is subsequently used by several tests.
 * 
 * The superclass contains a nested private class not intended for use. No instances of it can be 
 * created but it has to be kept around for legacy reasons as serialized instances of the class can be 
 * de-serialized. The constructor and the readResolve methods are entry points due to de-serialization
 * but other methods of the class (someMethod) are dead code. 
 * 
 * <b>NOTE</b><br>
 * This class is not meant to be (automatically) recompiled; it just serves documentation
 * purposes.
 * 
 * <!--
 * 
 * INTENTIONALLY LEFT EMPTY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SPECIFIED LINE NUMBERS ARE STABLE IF THE
 * CODE (E.G. IMPORTS) CHANGE.
