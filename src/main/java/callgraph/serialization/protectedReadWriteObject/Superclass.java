/**
 * This class was used to create a class file with some well defined attributes.
 * The created class is subsequently used by several tests.
 * 
 * Serializable class with protected read/writeObject methods nested in another class.
 * No instances of the class are created but it still can be de-serialized, accessed 
 * via public superclass or by extending the package. However during (de-)serialization 
 * the protected read/writeObject methods are not called as they need to be private to 
 * be called during (de-)serialization.
 * 
 * <b>NOTE</b><br>
 * This class is not meant to be (automatically) recompiled; it just serves
 * documentation purposes.
