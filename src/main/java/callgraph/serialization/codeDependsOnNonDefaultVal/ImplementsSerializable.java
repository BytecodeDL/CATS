 * This class was used to create a class file with some well defined attributes. The

 * 
 * Serializable class with a private method called in readObject during de-serialization. 
 * The call is only executed if the integer field of the class is at any value other than 
 * the default set in the field declaration. However the field is always set to the data 
 * types default value at the point the call is made.
