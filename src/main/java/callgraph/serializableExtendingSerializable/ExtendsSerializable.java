/**
 * This class was used to create a class file with some well defined attributes.
 * The created class is subsequently used by several tests.
 * 
 * This class extends a serializable class. The superclass does not have a visible no-args 
 * constructor. As the superclass itself is already serializable, this does not cause an error.
 * 
 * <b>NOTE</b><br>
 * This class is not meant to be (automatically) recompiled; it just serves
 * documentation purposes.
