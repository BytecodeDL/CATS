/**
 * This class represents a mathematical constant by simply wrapping an integer value. 
 * It has support for being saved to and loaded from an external file via the 
 * Serializable interface.
 * 
 * Defines methods to be called during (de-)serialization. These are entrypoints in the 
 * application scenario as (de-)serialization is performed in a main method in this project.
 *

 * purposes.

 *
 * INTENTIONALLY LEFT EMPTY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SPECIFIED LINE NUMBERS ARE STABLE IF THE
 * CODE (E.G. IMPORTS) CHANGE.
