		\toprule
		\textbf{Scenario}   					& \textbf{Description}  & \textbf{covered}\\
		\midrule
		MCALL & method invocation with a single call target; monomorphic calls include static method calls, constructor invocations, super calls and invocations of private methods & partially covered \\
		CINIT & invocation of static initializers; static initializers are called by the JVM at the load-time of a class& y\\
		VCALL & a virtual call; virtual calls include are interface methods, abstract methods etc. & partially covered\\
		BRANCHING & any kind of branching has to be covered; advanced call graph algorithms can utilize more precise type information & partially covered \\
		POT\_CALLBACK & potential callback because methods could be arbitrarily called; I.e. by native code, when an object type is passed as parameter of a native method & y\\
		INV\_CALLBACK & invisible callback because no native code is involved; the call graph seems to be complete & y\\
		OVERRIDDEN\_METHODS & correct dispatching of methods that have been overridden in subclasses& n\\
		DEFAULT\_METHODS & virtual calls to default implementations of interfaces (\textgreater Java 8) & n\\
		GEN\_TYPES & generic types have to be handled& y\\
		HANDLE\_ARRAYS & special handling of arrays can be supported; I.e. clone, toString, initilisation of arrays & y \\
		INVOKE\_DYN & invoke dynamic instructions should be handled properly & n\\
		NOT\_INIT\_CALL & call on an uninitialized value & n\\
		SERIALIZATION & methods that are implicitly called JVM during the serialization; I.e. the \emph{readObject} and \emph{writeObject} methods& n\\
		REFL\_INST\_CREATION & an instance of a class is created via Java's reflection mechanism& n\\
		REFL\_METHODCALL & a method is called via Java's reflection mechanism & y\\
		CLASSLOADING & & n\\
